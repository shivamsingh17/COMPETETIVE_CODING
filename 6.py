"""
Motu wants to learn Cricket from a coach, but firstly coach wants to test his IQ level, so he gave Motu 1 Red ball and 1 Black ball , and asked him to buy other x–1 red balls and other y–1 black balls from the market. But he put some conditions on buying balls, that if he has R red and B black balls then he can either buy B red balls or R black balls in one operation. He can perform this operation as many times as he want. But as Motu is not so good in solving problems so he needs your help. So you have to tell him whether his coach’s task possible or not.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers x,y.
Output:
For each testcase, print YES, if it is possible to complete coach task, else print NO(without quotes) in a separate line.

Constraints
1≤T≤100000
1≤x,y≤ 10^18
Sample Input:
 2
 1 2
 2 3
Sample Output:
 YES
 YES
